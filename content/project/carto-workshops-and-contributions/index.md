M﻿y first contribution to the CARTO environment was to develop materials for the [Carto Academy](https://carto.com/help/tutorials/using-builder/) depicting how to implement and interpret spatial tools on the web GIS platform. This has since been deprecated to accommodate for changes in the version of the current software.
