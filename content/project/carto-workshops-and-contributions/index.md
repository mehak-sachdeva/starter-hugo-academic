M﻿y first contribution to the CARTO environment was to develop materials for the [Carto Academy](https://carto.com/help/tutorials/using-builder/) depicting how to implement and interpret spatial tools on the web GIS platform. This has since been deprecated to accommodate for changes in the version of the current software.

### CartoCamp Meetup workshops

As a part of exploring visualization tools I held several workshops at the CartoCamp Meetup. The map above is an implementation of primary election data using leaflet and charts.js. The maps below were for a two-part collaborative workshop using Citibike data, Google Maps API (for routing between origin-destination pairs) and d3.js for visualization of routing data.
