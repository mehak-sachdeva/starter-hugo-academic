The Resilient Island Culture Studio was tasked to address housing and resiliency issues on Staten Island in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. With Make the Road New York as the studio client, emphasis was placed on serving lower-income communities that have not fully recovered from the storm. The studio proposes a Community Land Trust on Staten Islandâ€™s East Shore, in conjunction with a Resiliency Land Trust, to ensure sustained housing security for the East Shore community, and perpetual environmental security for Staten Island as a whole. The proposal is made feasible by Hurricane Sandy Recovery funds, but will benefit this unique part of New York City far into the future.
The larger studio goal involved creating a more resilient Staten Island in the wake of the opportunities provided by Hurricane Sandy.
