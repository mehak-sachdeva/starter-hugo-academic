As wealth gaps increase in American Cities certain lower income populations in cities will grow more vulnerable if their transportation needs are not met. We can use GIS to spatially research where the highly dense areas are that may be currently underserved by existing Subway infrastructure in cities. By identifying which residential and business zones in cities are accessible and which are being adequately served in their transportation needs, we can better indentify patterns of where to target permanent transportation infrastructure development in the future.
