<p style='text-align: justify;'> I am an Urban Science Faculty Fellow at the Center for Urban Science and Progress at New York University. I recently completed  my PostDoc and PhD in Geographic Information Science at the Spatial Analysis Research Center (ASU) with a focus on computational methods and local regression models to analyze urban processes with applications in crime, housing markets and urban health outcomes amongst others. I have prior experience as a geospatial data scientist at Carto (a SaaS web-mapping platform) and have a graduate degree in urban planning and analytics from Columbia University and an undergraduate degree and professional background in architecture. As a passionate researcher and an urban enthusiast, everything I have engaged in so far has been driven by a keen interest in the coexistence of urbanity and ecology and the impact of human footprint on the environment. In my spare time I run, hike, paint and read.</p>

Representative research on a geographical perspective on Simpson's Paradox and the scale of processes between local and global models:
