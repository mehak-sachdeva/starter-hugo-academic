title: A Geographical Perspective on Simpson’s Paradox
abstract: >-
  The concept of scale is inherent to and consequential for the modeling of
  geographical processes. However, scale also causes huge problems for spatial
  analysis because the results of many types of spatial analysis appear to be
  dependent on the scale of the units for which data are reported. Consequently,
  it is often difficult to reconcile the results of calibrating the same spatial
  model with the same data aggregated to different spatial scales. This is the
  well-known Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) and the problem is also
  manifested in the extreme version of the MAUP, Simpson’s paradox. Despite
  decades of research, spatial analysis is still beset with both these problems.
  Previous examinations of scale effects in spatial analysis have concentrated
  on trying to establish a link with the resolution and configuration of
  geographic zones for which data are reported, all typically at a global level
  of analysis. Here a different approach is followed which takes advantage of
  local models to understand how aggregating data which may have been derived
  from different processes can result in different (and often contradictory)
  inferences from global and local analyses, exemplifying a spatial instance of
  the classic Simpson’s paradox.
