title: Invited Five-hour technical virtual workshop series on Spatial
  Heterogeneity, Inference and Visualization
abstract: The overall goal of the workshop is to introduce participants to
  multiscale spatial modeling and engage in a discussion of the scale of
  geographic processes and their measurement. Multiscale Geographically Weighted
  Regression (MGWR) is a cutting-edge modeling technique which integrates both
  nomothetic and ideographic approaches in geography and allows a more nuanced
  interpretation of place and space. Participants will be introduced to the
  field of local modeling and the opportunities it presents to measure the scale
  at which geographic processes operate. Participants will also complete
  hands-on training in the use of MGWR in research, and will be encouraged to
  use the provided code for their own future research.
